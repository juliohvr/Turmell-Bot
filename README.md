# Turmell-Bot
It is a cable-driven ankle rehabilitation parallel robot. We approximated the ankle model by using draw-wire sensors to find the foot position regarding the shank. We use the product of exponentials formula, and the cables are antagonistic for equilibrate the tension forces and move the foot in a group of movements representing a Riemannian chart.
